## Intro
Welcome back to my Blog series! This is the first one I'm posting this semester even though it is
technically number 4. A lot has happened but I am now mentally stable enough to remember that these
are supposed to exist. Anyway enough about that... let's talk about Python!

### What is Python?
Pythons are snakes, but this is not an animal blog. This is an IT blog. So for us Python, while named
named after our scaly friend, is a programming language! In my own personal opinion, it is one of the
easiest programming languages and most forgiving that I have had the pleasure of learning the basics to.
It is much less strict than, let's say, JavaScript for instance which will shout at you for every line
that does not end with a a proper `;`. So let's go over it.

### Printing with Python
In this Blog I will teach you how to print with Python and also talk about some of the pros of using
this particular language.
```
print ('This is the command to print a statement')

```
