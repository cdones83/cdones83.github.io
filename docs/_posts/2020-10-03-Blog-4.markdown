Welcome back! Today were gonna go over showing off code in our blog posts. Last week I did this when
talking about how to post pictures in the jekyll blogs.

The image above shows how to do highlights. Basically with highlights you choose where it starts
denoted by the first set of brackets and where it ends by the second set. The first set also has you input
the language your are writing in.

I learned how to do that last week and this week I have learned more ways. You can also create what is
called Fenced Code Blocks using the three backticks (```) or three tildas(~~~).
```
This is an example
