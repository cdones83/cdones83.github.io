Welcome back! Today were gonna go over showing off code in our blog posts. Last week I did this when
talking about how to post pictures in the jekyll blogs.

And this was the output:

The image above shows how to do highlights. Basically with highlights you choose where it starts
denoted by the first set of brackets and where it ends by the second set. The first set also has you input
the language your are writing in.

I learned how to do that last week and this week I have learned more ways. You can also create what is
called Fenced Code Blocks using the three backticks (```) or three tildas(~~~).
```
This is an example
```
You can even highlight this way. Just like how we specified the language we used when using the brackets,
we can add on the language we are using at the end of the first set of backticks to highlight the code
being used.

```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "age": 25
}
```
So there you have it! More ways to highlight code. Next week I'll try talking about Dockerfile and I'll
be using these new methods to better show what is going on. Sorry it's so short this week but I hope this
helped anyone looking to learn how to highligh their code. I'll see ya next time.
