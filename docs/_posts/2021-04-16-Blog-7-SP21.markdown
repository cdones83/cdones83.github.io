## Intro
Alright Blog 7! Missed a few blogs in between but that's fine! Everything's probably fine...anyway! Today
I'll be talking about creating a website using HTML. For this we will be using a free site called
[glitch.com](https://glitch.com).

### Making a site
Luckily this site is free and you can sign up by going to the upper-right corner of the screen. Once your
account has been created we can begin creating projects! Click on the new project button next to your
profile pic in the top right corner and select the hello-webpage template. The page should now look
something like this:

![Project page](https://i.imgur.com/ngNRpj9.png)

On the left side of the screen look at the assets and click on the index.html. This is where most of your
code for the site will be.

Above is what should be showing on the screen for your first project. For the actual site it will look
like this:

Let's walk through the code a little. At the very top you will notice `<!DOCTYPE html>`. This tells the
browser that the page is being displayed using HTML as its coding language. The page will always start
with this before anything else.
