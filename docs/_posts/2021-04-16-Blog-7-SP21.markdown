## Intro
Alright Blog 7! Missed a few blogs in between but that's fine! Everything's probably fine...anyway! Today
I'll be talking about creating a website using HTML. For this we will be using a free site called
[glitch.com](https://glitch.com).

### Making a site
Luckily this site is free and you can sign up by going to the upper-right corner of the screen. Once your
account has been created we can begin creating projects!
