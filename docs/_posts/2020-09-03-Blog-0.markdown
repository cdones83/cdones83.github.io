This is the first of many blogs for CIT480. I am a student and I hope to improve my understanding of the
materials of this class by creating these weekly blogs. Should anyone be reading this, I hope that the
information on these pages will be of some use to you in helping you reslove any problems that you may 
run across.

For this Blog_0 I will be going over how to create a virtual machine that runs on Ubuntu.

For starters, you will need to make sure that your machine has the option to run Virtual Machines enabled.
In my case, I just recently built the computer that I am using and was not able to begin using virtual
machines until I enabled them in the BIOS.
