Welcome back! This is Blog_5 and this week I will be talking about docker and Dockerfiles. So what is
docker and what can we do with it? Docker is an application that lets us create containers that have
everything we need to run other applications. In a way it's almost like the virtual machine I am currently
using to create these posts. We take an image of what we want, and in this case an image refers to what
the container will have already downloaded on to it for us to begin using it. There are presets we can
call on or we can make our very own with what are called Dockerfiles. They contain the base OS image for
the container to install and we put in ourn own commands to install any other application or software
we might want when we build the container.

Let's get started with installing docker. Luckily for us we can use a pre-installed command called snap.
The command will look like this:
```
snap install docker
```
Simple right?
