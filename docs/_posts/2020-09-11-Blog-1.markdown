Welcome to Blog_1! Just to recap from the previous blog, we set up a virtual machine on our computers
that uses Ubuntu as our operating system (OS). In this blog I will be going over how to set up a LAMP.

So what does LAMP stand for? Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. LAMP is an open source web development
platform. Each letter in LAMP constitutes one of its layers and it is often referred to as a LAMP stack.
Linux is the OS, Apache acts as the web server, MySQL is the database, and PHP is the scripting language.
Luckily for us, we already have Linux for our OS in the form of Ubuntu. Meaning three more layers to go
until we have a complete stack!

So let's start with what we will need to make this all happen. For downloading everything that we will
need to get this LAMP stack running, we will need to open up our terminal. This can be done by clicking
on the icon in the bottom left of the screen. Once selected it will open up the apps that your current
virtual machine contains. Either look through the apps to find Terminal or simply type it in the search
bar. Once it's open we are ready to begin.

Let's get Apache, specifically we will be downloading and installing Apache2. in the terminal type the
command:

apt-get install apache2
