Hi! Today we will be working on making these blogs seem more professional. So how do we do that? Good
question! For one, we should add more pictures. I bet you looked at my last couple of posts and thought:
"Wow, this would be great with pictures!" Your are correct. Instead of adding in pictures to those
previous blogs however, I'd like them to stay as they are and show a gradual progression of me getting
better at making these. So with that being said, let's get into it!

If you have been following along with me on this tiny journey you should know by now that I am using
a virtual machine running Ubuntu. It also happens to be hosting this blog. It's my first time doing this
but maybe there are other people in a similar situation to me who need to know how to post pictures on a
jekyll blog post. I did a little bit of research, and here's what I've learned. We can definitely post
pictures on this blog. I know, pretty exciting stuff. They require URLs. What does that mean? Let's say
say you found a picture of a puppy on the internet and you wanted to put it in this post. Well, since
another site is hosting that picture you can copy the link to it and you would be all set. But what if you
have your own puppy? So you take a pic and put it in a folder but it doesn't have a link? How is the
internet supposed to begin their worshipping? Never fear, I will cover that. The solution is a popular
site called imgur.
