## Intro
Welcome back to my blog series. If you recall in one of my last posts I talked about ways to strengthen
your passwords. Today I will expand on that on talk a little more about cyber attacks. Updating your
passwords was a way to protect your information from a form of cyber attack known as brute forcing where
a program puts in multiple iterations of letters, numbers and symbols until it eventually matches your
password. Today I will be talking about 3 other forms of cyber attacks: malware, phishing, and
man-in-the-middle attacks.

### Malware Attacks
Malware is a shortend version of malicious software. As the name implies it is software designed to harm
and/or steal information from your computer by abusing vulnerabilities in your network. There are
different kinds of malware such as wroms, spyware, ransomware, etc and each one does something slightly
different than the other. In general, malware is capable of blocking access to your system, can install
programs without your knowledge and permission to steal data, and even send data from your hard drive to
a third party.

How and when does it attack you? Normally you will be targeted while browsing the internet. Malware can
be installed into your machine if you were to click on a suspicious link or enter into an unsecure site.
Many times hackers will create bots that will go into chats and resemble people talking and offering
free prizes while posting links that actually downloads for malware. 

How can you protect against it? While there is o 100% way to be safe from malware attacks, there are many
things you can do to prevent yourself from becoming a victim. Installing anti-virus software is one way
to protect yourself. Nowadays there are plenty of companies that provide free services to protect against
multiple forms of malware. While their free services are not as strong as paid services, it is still
better to have little protection than none at all. In a lot of cases they even provide a month of free
trial for their paid services and it never hurts to take advantage of it when you can. Most of these
anti-virus programs will come with preventive measures as well as scanning and quarantining programs in
case your computer is already infected. Another way to protect yourself is by being wary of what you see
online. Try not to click on links unless you are sure it is from a trusted source. When on websites, look
for the verification marker indicating the the site you are on is safe and has been judged to be safe and
secure. It looks like a little padlock next to the URL:

### Phishing Attacks
Phishing is a type of attack that targets you through your emails. Spam mail is sometimes a kind of
phishing. When you give your email to a company, sometimes that information is sold to others so that
they can send you advertisements of their own products. Sometimes this information does not go to people
with the best of intentions. These emails will either trick you into thinking you've won something so you
click their link, or scare you by mimicking a trusted website or company while asking you for your
information.

How can you protect yourself? In most cases such as emails or on mobile phones, they will be designed to
identify suspicious emails and messages and will categorize them as such. As is the case with malware,
you can also download software to protect yourself from phishing attacks if you accidently open one up.
Another way is multi-factor authentication requiring you to input a scurity code using a device that you
personally have on you. Let's say you fell prey to a phsihing email and gave someone your password. By
using MFA they now will not be able to access your account with just that. A notification should then
be sent to your phone or other device letting you know someone is trying to access your account and it
will guide you along the appropriate steps to resecure your information.

### Man-in-the-Middle Attacks
Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks are a kind of cyber attack that reroutes your normal connection to a
fake website when you are trying to access a legitimate one. Most computers are so fast that when
you input the name of site it loads up in less than a second after you hit the enter key. What we don't
realize is that many steps have happened within those few nanoseconds to conect you to your designated
site. MITM attacks happen in those tiny windows of opportunity by redirecting you to fake sites or sites
you never intended to be on in the first place. These kinds of attaks are more likely to occur on public
wifis where anyone is able to access the connection. Because public wifi lets anyone use it, it is
naturally weaker in protection than a home or office connection. Your data is transferred over the
connection in packets from one router to another until it reaches its destination. By accessing the
public connection, the hackers now have a way to intercept your data and outright steal it or redirect
it.

One of the few ways you can protect yourself is by using a Virtual private network (VPN). VPNs mask your
IP and can encrypt your data to keep it safe from hackers. Encrypting the data doesn;t mean it can't be
stolen, but it does mean that the hacker will have a much harder time accessing the information even
if they managed to get it. In this way, it also a good idea to use HTTPS sites to protect yourself from
MITM attacks. HTTPS websites automatically data and prevent attackers from accessing communications of
your device and their web services.

### Conclusion
Hope this helps you stay safe when browsing the internet. If you noticed, these kinds of attacks all
work together to steal your data. Your first either fooled by a phishing attack or become a victim of
MITM attacks. From there you forced with a malware and your information is put at risk. Just like these
attacks work together and become stronger, so do your defenses and preventative measures when they are
combined. Like I said earlier, there is no 100% protection against malware. But by using multiple safety
measures we can greatly reduce the chance of malware or the effectiveness of malware. Stay safe and see
ya in my next blog post!
