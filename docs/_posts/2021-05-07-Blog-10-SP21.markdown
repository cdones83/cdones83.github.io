## Intro
Alright last blog in the series! It has definitely been a semester... my mind has been everywhere and
definitely not on these. I doubt a lot of people ever really came to this to learn, but hey, if your that
1%, I appreaciate you and in this last blog we will go over that website I was working on!

### Tables
So tables may seem complicated at first but are very easy to create. First we start with `<table>` tag.
Go down to the next line and make sure you indent as is the proper way. For every row created we use the
tag `<tr>`. Starting with the header we move on to the next line and use `<th>` tag which is the header
portion of the table. All foloowing rows will all use `<tr>` but all data columns wll use the tag `<td>`.
FOr example:
```
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Name</th>
		<th>Value</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>SOME COMPANY</td>
		<td>SOME VALUE</td>
	</tr>
</table>
```
That would create a very basic table. From here we will go over some css.
