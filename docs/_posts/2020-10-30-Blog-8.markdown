## Intro
Welcome back to my series for CIT480! This week I will be talking about ansible. Now that I've done the
lab for my class, I have a better understanding of it and feel like I can properly talk about it. So as
always, what is it? Remember Dockerfiles? Ansible is like that, except it's a separate installation and
uses its own commands. With it we can create a file that automatically begins to download and setup
applications for our newly created container. I think I prefer using Dockerfile just because we create a
base image, but it never hurts to know multiple ways to speed up an installation. Let's get started.

### Installing Ansible
Hands down the easiest part in the whole process. A simple `apt install` or `apt-get install` command
will get the job done like so:

```
apt install ansible
```

It's important to remember that when doing this we will have already created a container to run the file
in. If you cannot remember how to make a container using Docker then you can always refer back to [Blog_5](https://cdones83.github.io/virtual/machine/ubuntu/docker/2020/10/09/Blog-5.html).
Well now it should be installed so let's move on.

### Creating The YML File
Before we make the actual file we need to create a directory first. This directory will be located in
/home. Go ahead and `cd` to move to home or create the directory directly as shown below in the following
code:

```
mkdir -p /home/ansible
```

The -p means that it will create a parent directory first if it does not already exist. Then move into the
directory. Just as a side note we did not have to name this directory "ansible". You can name it however
you like. Now from within this directory we can create our file. Name it however you like as long as
it ends with ".yml". You can use any editor of your choice as well. Now we can proceed to setting up the
file.
