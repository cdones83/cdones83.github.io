## Intro
Welcome back to my series for CIT480! This week I will be talking about ansible. Now that I've done the
lab for my class, I have a better understanding of it and feel like I can properly talk about it. So as
always, what is it? Remember Dockerfiles? Ansible is like that, except it's a separate installation and
uses its own commands. With it we can create a file that automatically begins to download and setup
applications for our newly created container. I think I prefer using Dockerfile just because we create a
base image, but it never hurts to know multiple ways to speed up an installation. Let's get started.

##Installing Ansible
Hands down the easiest part in the whole process. A simple `apt install` or `apt-get install` command
will get the job done like so:

```
apt install ansible
```

It's important to remember that when doing this we will have already created a container to run the file
in. If you cannot remember how to make a container using Docker then you can always refer back to [Blog_5](https://cdones83.github.io/virtual/machine/ubuntu/docker/2020/10/09/Blog-5.html).
