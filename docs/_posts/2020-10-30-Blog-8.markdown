## Intro
Welcome back to my series for CIT480! This week I will be talking about ansible. Now that I've done the
lab for my class, I have a better understanding of it and feel like I can properly talk about it. So as
always, what is it? Remember Dockerfiles? Ansible is like that, except it's a separate installation and
uses its own commands. With it we can create a file that automatically begins to download and setup
applications for our newly created container. I think I prefer using Dockerfile just because we create a
base image, but it never hurts to know multiple ways to speed up an installation. Let's get started.

##Installing Ansible
Hands down the easiest part in the whole process. A simple `apt` or `apt-get` command will get the job
dones like so:

```
apt ansible
```
