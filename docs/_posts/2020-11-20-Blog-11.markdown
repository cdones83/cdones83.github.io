## Intro
Welcome back to my blog series for CIT480! Today I decided I will be talking about Vi, the text
editor that is usualyl installed into Ubuntu by default. I honestly do not have much experience with
Vi and install Nano almost every time I set up a new machine because it is so much easier. However,
there are people who swear by Vi and today I will explain some basics about it and you can decide
yourself which one it is you would prefer to use.

### Vi - Getting Started
First off open up the terminal. You can make a new directory or or just start creating files, it's up to
you. I like to keep things organized so I'm just gonna make a new directory called Tutorial using the
follow command:
```
mkdir Tutorial
```
Once inside we will use `vi <filename>` to create a file. Name it whatever you like. Should a file with
the same name already exist, it will instead open that file.

### Vi Modes
So Vi has two modes:
* command mode
* insert mode
In command mode it is the letters that you use to move around the document, as opposed to the arrow
keys. You will be in the mode by default but can enter it by hitting the ESC button. In insert mode you
can begin typing words like a normal editor. In order to switch to insert mode press `i` on your
keyboard.

### Navigating the Doc
Alright, so like I said previously you do not move around the document using the arrow keys. Instead you
use the letters h,j,k, and l to do the following:
| Key | Movement |
| ------ | ------ |
| h | Left one space |
| j | Down one line |
| k | Up one line |
| l | Right one space |
