## Intro
Welcome back to my blog series for CIT480! Today I decided I will be talking about Vi, the text
editor that is usualyl installed into Ubuntu by default. I honestly do not have much experience with
Vi and install Nano almost every time I set up a new machine because it is so much easier. However,
there are people who swear by Vi and today I will explain some basics about it and you can decide
yourself which one it is you would prefer to use.

### Vi - Getting Started
First off open up the terminal. You can make a new directory or or just start creating files, it's up to
you. I like to keep things organized so I'm just gonna make a new directory called Tutorial using the
follow command:
```
mkdir Tutorial
```
Once inside we will use `vi <filename>`
