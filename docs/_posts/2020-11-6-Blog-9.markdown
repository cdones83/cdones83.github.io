## Intro
Welcome back to my blog series! This week is gonna be a quick one but hopefully it will be very useful to
anyone hoping to work on there markdown language skills. I've gone over a few things before such as code
blocks and image posting. Today I'll go over a few more things to help make your pages (and hopefully
mine) look a little more professional. So let's get started.

### Headings
You might have noticed last week I started titling sections. Definitely makes these sections more 
appealing to the eye. Even better is that it is super easy to do! Down below is a table showing a few
of the heading options

| Syntax | Output |
| --------- -| --------- -|
| *## Header 1* | ## Header 1 |
