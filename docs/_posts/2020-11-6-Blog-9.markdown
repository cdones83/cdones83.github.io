## Intro
Welcome back to my blog series! This week is gonna be a quick one but hopefully it will be very useful to
anyone hoping to work on there markdown language skills. I've gone over a few things before such as code
blocks and image posting. Today I'll go over headings to help make your pages (and hopefully
mine) look a little more professional. So let's get started.

### Headings
You might have noticed last week I started titling sections. Definitely makes these sections more 
appealing to the eye. Even better is that it is super easy to do! Down below is a table showing a few
of the heading options.

It's important to remember that when using the `#` that there is a space right after it otherwise it will
not read correctly and will result in plain text.

Alternatively you could use `==` or `--` on the line below to create headings:

```
Heading 1
================

Heading 2
----------------
```

### Conclusion and sidenotes
It was a short one this week but as always I still hope this helps. Next time I'll be talking about a few
of the things I've learned from doing AWS or Amazon Web Services. So look forward tot hat and see ya next
time.
