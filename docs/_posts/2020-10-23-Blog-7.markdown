Welcome back to my blog series for CIT 480. This is Blog 7 and if you remember last week we talked about
Dockerfiles. This week I think I'll change course and talk about account security. This is known as
hardening an account. Often the word "hardening" is used to refer to the various things people do to add
extra security measures to an account, most typically a root account. Today I'll just talk about normal
things you can do to keep your account protected. This doesn't apply to anything specific but account
security is also big part of Computer Information Technology and it's importance should not be
overlooked. Let's get started.

So let's say you made an account for a new email. Your going to be using this email to recieve all your
important and personal information, maybe from family, doctors or other places that may have access to
your personal info. It would be bad if someone got access to your account and had all this sensitive
information. The obvious thing to do, and what is required by almost everyone, is that the account has a
password. What makes a good password though? Length for one thing. A way for people to gain access to
your account is through method called brute forcing. Basically they have a program that puts in every
possible combination until eventually it gets the correct sequence of letters and numbers that make your
password. The longer your password is the more possible combinations there are.
